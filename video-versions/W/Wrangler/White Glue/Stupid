Stupid
Stupid

What do you do?
How do you know
What you must have
To cause a war
Down to the core

If all he needs
A little thought

Stupid
Stupid
Stupid

Not everything
Is what it seems
It's all it ...
Now what is done
A thousand miles
Above the ground

Ah, ah, ah

Stupid
Stupid

How do you hear?
What do you see?
Just what
A fucking waste of breath

What do you think
That it means
When all the step is thee

Stupid
Stupid

What do you do?
How do you know?

What do you do?
How do you know?

Stupid
Stupid
Stupid
Stupid
Stupid
Stupid
