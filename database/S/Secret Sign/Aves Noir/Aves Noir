Spread out? your wings
... as there's night?

The world down there fear you
As you take flight

Intelligence? is gone
You have ...

... incoming
You will look for decoys

Cast stones from above
Unbeknownst to your prayer
... for this place
Comes ...
...
You will always recognize my face

Was it you
Close to sky
...
In the dark?
Was it you?
It was you to return
...

... your eyes
Revealing your lie
... other
When you take flight

Cast stones from above
Unbeknownst to your prayer
... for this place
Comes ...
Until ... your way / took you away
You will always recognize my face

Was it you
Close to sky
...
In the dark?
Was it you
... (moon)?
To return
...
